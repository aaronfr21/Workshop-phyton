# There is a variant of the import statement that imports names from a module directly into the importing module’s symbol table
from fibo import fib, fib2
fib(500)
# output
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

# There is even a variant to import all names that a module defines:
from fibo import *
fib(500)
# output
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

# If the module name is followed by as, then the name following as is bound directly to the imported module.
import fibo as fib
fib.fib(500)
# output
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

# It can also be used when utilising from with similar effects:
from fibo import fib as fibonacci
fibonacci(500)
# output
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
